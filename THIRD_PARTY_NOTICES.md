# Third-party notices

This repository does not bundle any third-party code or binaries. During the
build, `scripts/setup.ps1` downloads the ReXGlue SDK and its dependencies (git
submodules) and compiles them on your machine. The resulting files in `build`
and `dist` are covered by the licenses below. If you redistribute any built
files, you are responsible for complying with them.
